# ðŸš€ AWS Cloud Cost Optimizer (Bash + AWS CLI)

This project is a **Bash Shell Script** that connects to AWS via the **AWS CLI** to analyze your environment and detect unused or underutilized resources that may be generating unnecessary costs.  

The script is lightweight, requires no dependencies other than AWS CLI, and provides a **menu-driven report** to help you optimize your AWS bill.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

The script currently checks for the following resources:

- **EC2 Instances** â†’ Lists all instances with type, state, and launch time.  
- **Unattached EBS Volumes** â†’ Volumes not attached to any instance (still incurring charges).  
- **S3 Buckets** â†’ Lists all buckets in your account.  
- **Unattached Elastic IPs (EIPs)** â†’ Public IPs allocated but not associated with any instance.  
- **Unused Load Balancers** â†’ Load balancers with no target groups or empty target groups.  
- **Unattached ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)** â†’ Available ENIs not in use.  
- **Idle NAT Gateways** â†’ NAT gateways with no traffic in the last 1 hour (costly if unused).
